        <h2>Join Us in Celebrating Texas Arbor Day!</h2>
        <p>
          Texas Arbor Day is a special time for our community to come together
          and recognize the importance of trees in our environment and daily
          lives. Celebrated annually on the first Friday in November, Texas
          Arbor Day is dedicated to planting, nurturing, and appreciating trees
          that bring beauty, shade, and cleaner air to our city. Here in
          Rowlett, we’re proud to honor this tradition with an exciting
          opportunity for our residents to make an impact on our local
          ecosystem—one tree at a time.

        <h2>A Brief History of Texas Arbor Day</h2>
        <p>
          The Arbor Day tradition began over 150 years ago when J. Sterling
          Morton, a journalist and nature enthusiast from Nebraska, proposed a
          holiday to plant trees. His idea quickly gained popularity, and Arbor
          Day soon spread to states across the country. Texas established its
          own Arbor Day, with a unique focus on planting trees suited to our
          climate and landscapes, providing benefits like soil stabilization,
          wildlife habitats, and natural cooling. By celebrating Arbor Day in
          November, Texas offers the best planting season for young trees to
          thrive.
