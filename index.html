                <h3>Planting</h3>
                <p>Plant Bald Cypress in wet or moist areas. They are particularly well-suited for swampy conditions but can also adapt to drier soils.</p>
                <h3>Care</h3>
                <p>Requires regular watering. Mulch around the base to retain moisture. Minimal pruning is needed, mainly to remove dead or damaged branches.</p>
